# AttendIT

## Project Overview
Over the course of our undergraduate experience, we’ve found that attendance isn’t always the easiest to keep track of, especially in classes with hundreds of students. We’ve also found that each instructor seems to handle attendance somewhat differently, with some using daily quizzes, while others resort to verbally asking each student, one-by-one, if they’re present during class. A question arises, is there a way to create a better, more efficient attendance system that’s easy to learn and easy to use?
This is the primary goal of our attendance app project. 
After successful completion of the app, the task of taking attendance would become a mostly hands-off experience. Additionally, instructors would be able to easily track attendance metrics across time, and students would have access to reliable feedback and suggestions regarding their attendance habits.
